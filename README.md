Exploding Kittens is an exciting card game built using the MERN stack. Players must strategically draw cards from a deck while avoiding explosive kittens that can lead to their defeat. Featuring captivating gameplay and vibrant visuals, Exploding Kittens delivers an exhilarating and addictive experience for players of all ages.

## Rules
- If the card drawn from the deck is a cat card, then the card is removed from the deck.
- If the card is exploding kitten (bomb) then the player loses the game.
- If the card is defusing card, then the card is removed from the deck. This card can be used to defuse one bomb that may come in subsequent cards drawn from the deck.
- If the card is a shuffle card, then the game is restarted and the deck is filled with 5 cards again.
